# GrandTotal Plugins
Javascript based plugins to extend GrandTotal
### How it works
Download one of the samples and create your own plugin by customizing the plist and the js file.
Plugins can be installed by double clicking them and are located in ~/Library/Application Support/com.mediaatelier.GrandTotal3/Plugins/
Once installed, you can edit the JavaScript file in place. Changes ob the .plist file require a restart of GrandTotal.
